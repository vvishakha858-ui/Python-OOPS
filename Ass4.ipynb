        "\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are real-world entities. These objects contain data (called attributes/properties) and methods (functions that operate on the data). OOP makes code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
